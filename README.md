# RailsBase16 Color Scheme for Sublime Text


This repository contains the color scheme `tmTheme` files, compatible with __TextMate__ and __Sublime Text__.

The color scheme files have been generated with [a fork](https://github.com/tompave/RailsBase16-builder) of the original Base16 Builder, which aims to provide better syntax support for the __Ruby__ programming language and for the __Ruby on Rails__ framework.  
That repository also contains [examples](https://github.com/tompave/RailsBase16-builder#improved-syntax-highlighting) of the syntax highlighting. 

## Installation

The easiest way to install is via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/), the color schemes are available as `rails_base_16`.

Alternatively, you can clone the repo inside the `Packages` directory of your Sublime Text data directory.
